# VisRAG-Gen Generation Pipeline Configuration
#
# Vision-based RAG generation pipeline that processes document images directly
# with VLMs (Vision Language Models) instead of parsing text.
# Preserves visual information like layout, tables, and embedded images.
#
# Parameters:
#   retrieval_pipeline_name: Name of retrieval pipeline (must return image chunks)
#   llm: VLM model identifier with vision support (e.g., gpt-4o, gpt-4-turbo)
#   image_processing_mode: Strategy for handling multiple images
#     - multi_image: Pass all images to VLM in single call (best performance)
#     - concatenate: Merge images into single composite (single-image VLM fallback)
#   concatenation_direction: horizontal or vertical (only for concatenate mode)
#   top_k: Number of image chunks to retrieve (default: 5)
#
