# Vector Search Retrieval Pipeline Configuration
#
# Uses VectorChord for vector similarity search.
# Requires pre-computed embeddings on chunks and queries.
#
# Parameters:
#   search_mode: "single" for cosine similarity, "multi" for MaxSim
#   top_k: Number of results to retrieve (default: 10)
#   batch_size: Number of queries to process per batch (default: 100)
